This site is a work in progress that has several inter-related goals :


1. a publicly accessible RDF source of information on Solid resources

The RDF knowledge graph (tab 2 above) is a start at such a resource. I gathered it by hand from existing web pages and repos and and from the work of Denis Sirlov[1] and Mathias Everying[2].  It needs fleshing out both in terms of resources not yet listed and in terms of details of resources currently listed.  My apologies for any omissions or inaccurracies.
  
2. a set of terms and shapes capable of describing Solid resources

3. a generalized pattern for RDF modeling of Organizations and Projects based on the Solid Project experience

4. software that uses the data and shapes to provide rich read-write access to the data

5. a process to generate portions of the solidproject.org from portions of the RDF source
